CLIENT

* ddns-client is started with IPv4 and IPv6 Address and LOC in the
  commandline it uses tcpclient and ddnsc to register at the
  server. Then it sleeps for leadetime-17 renews the registration and
  starts over sleeping. 

* If ddns-clientd recives a SIGTERM it deregisters at the server 
  and exits.


SERVER

ddnsd

* ddnsd is started by tcpserver if a connection form the internet
  arrives it chroots to ROOT and drops privileges to UID:GID it gets
  information about the remote connection by enviroment variables
  conforming to ucspi-tcp it expects a single parameter describing
  DOT/ZONEDIR

* ddnsd reads a 68 byte request and answers with a 68 byte reply then quits

* using the uid from the request it looks up this user in data.cdb if
  not found it indicates an error, else it reads HOSTN, SECRET and TTL

* SECRET is used to encrypt the remaining 64 bytes of the request

* if it is a setentryrequest ddnsd creates DOT/ZONEDIR/HOSTN and puts
  the IP Adress of the client in there then sends a reply with a
  leasetime of TTL. for creation it uses a file in tmp which gets
  moved to DOT/ZONEDIR/HOSTN when completed

* if it is a renewentryrequest it touches DOT/ZONEDIR/HOSTN and replys
  with a zero leaseti me.

* if it is a killentryrequest is deletes DOT/ZONEDIR/HOSTN


ddns-cleand

* ddns-cleand runs chrooted in ROOT and drops privileges to UID:GID
  expecting DOT as a parameter

* it crawls the direcrorytree DOT/* looks up for every file found the
  uid in data.cdb to find TTL. If mtime + TTL < now() it removes the
  file.

* it deletes all files in tmp older then 1.5 days


filedns

* filedns listens on port 53:UDP for DNS requests. it chroots to ROOT
  and drops privileges to UID:GID. ROOT should point to the DOT
  directory in ddns/filedns ROOT.

* after reciving a request it converts the data from the dnstree to a
  filetree. drt.dyn.rc23.cx will get cx/rc23/dyn/drt. it tries to read
  this file and deliver the data found in there to the client.

Example directorystructure:
 
ROOT (for ddnsd and ddns-cleand) = /whatever/root/
DOT = dot
ZONEDIR = cx/rc23/dyn

/whatever/root/dot/cx/rc23/dyn/
            |   |
            |   + filedns runs chrooted here
            |
            + ddnsd and ddns-clean run chrooted here

If updaterequests should arrive on c0re.rc23.cx:3456 and dnsservice
for zone "dyn.rc23.cx" should be provided at c0re.rc23.cx do:

ROOT=/whatever/root envuidgid ddnsw ddnsd dot/cx/rc23/dyn
ROOT=/whatever/root envuidgid ddnsw ddns-cleand dot
ROOT=/whatever/root/dot envuidgid ddnsr filedns 

logging will be done by all three programms to stdout so they will be
run best with daemontolls and supervise.

ddnsw is the user for writing ddns data.  ddnsr is the user for
reading ddns data and should be member of ddnsws primary group.


ddnsd-data

* reads data from stdin creating data.cdb.  the data is oriented
  linewise and contains comma seperated fields.  uid,shared
  secret,hostn,ttl.
