.SH NAME
uint32_pack_big \- write an unsigned big-endian 32-bit integer
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <uint32.h>

uint32 \fIu\fR;

void \fBuint32_pack_big\fP(char \fIs\fR[4],uint32 \fIu\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
uint32 is a 32-bit unsigned integer type, normally either unsigned int
or unsigned long.

uint32_unpack_big portably reads a uint32 as stored on a big-endian
architecture (i.e. in network byte order) from \fIs\fR and writes it
info \fIr\fR in the native byte order.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
uint32_unpack_big(3), uint32_pack(3)
