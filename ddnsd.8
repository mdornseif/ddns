.SH NAME
ddnsd \- server for the ddns protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ddnsd /datadir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ddnsd
is a server for the 
.I ddns 
protocol
.P
.B ddnsd 
expects to be called for each network connection according to the 
.I ucspi-tcp 
.IR interface .
This can be done by using 
.IR tcpserver (8).
.P
.B Upon startup 
.B ddnsd
will 
.IR chroot (3)
to the directory given by the enviroment variable
.IR $ROOT .
It then drops privileges to the user and group set by
.I $UID
and
.IR $GID .
.P
.B ddnsd 
will read a ddns request from stdin which should
connect to the network socket, see 
.I ucspi-tcp 
for further details.
It tries to look up the user id send by the client in
.I data.cdb
.P
.I data.cdb
should be created with 
.IR ddnsd-data (8)
.P
If the user is found 
.I ddnsd creates a file in 
.I /datadir 
named like the username found in 
.I data.cdb.
The client gets send an acknowledgment via stdout.
.P
The file creation is done like the 
.I maildir algorythmn
outlines.
.B ddnsd
uses the directory
.I /tmp 
for file creation. If an error occures 
.B ddnsd 
might leave temporary files in this directory which an be 
safely deleted if older than 1.5 days.
.P
The format of the created file is described in
.IR ddnsd-file (5)
.P
If the client wants to renew an entry
.B ddnsd
just touches the file, if the client wants to kill
an entry 
.B ddnsd
removes the file.
.P
.B ddns-clientd
logs to stderr. 
.BR multilog (8)
is well suited for handling this.
.P
.B ddnsd 
doesn't allow to register the same uid twice but it allows to
renew or kill an entry even if it is older than it's leasetime.
.P
.SH BUGS
Many. Logging, errorcodes are not consistent, ddns is not suited to use 
udp as a transport, ttl is not dynamically used, files are left in /tmp
and surly a lot other bugs.
