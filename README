Setting up a client:

You have know your DDNS-UID (100 in this example) and your shared
secret ('superNikNik' in theis example.  After you fired up your
internet connection try someting like

$ DDNS_SERVER_ADDR=c0re.rc23.cx \
  DDNS_SERVER_PORT=3456 \
  DDNS_UID=100 \
  KEY="superNikNik" \ 
  ./ddns-clientd 1.2.3.4 0 50 57 9.7 N 6 54 08.3 E 5700 5000 1500 5000

This assumes your IP is 1.2.3.4 and you have no IPv6 Address, which
means 0.  Your Location is Vogelsangerstr. 286 in Cologne at 57m
altitude and your facility is 50m in diameter. The Number is acurate
to 15m in horizontal and 50m in vertical direction.  The last three
numbers can be left out. I assume you use a ddns Server running at
c0re.rc23.cx:3456.

ddns-clientd will now connect to the server and register there. It
will sleep a server specified amount of time (at the moment 90s) and
renew its registration. If it recives SIGTERM it will deregister and
exit.

now try:

$ nslookup myname.dyn.rc23.cx
Server:  localhost
Address:  127.0.0.1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    myname.dyn.rc23.cx
Address:  1.2.3.4

Welcome to the exciting world of dynamic dns!
