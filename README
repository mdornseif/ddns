This is Relase 0.1 "Hak-Nam" of ddns.
Up to now the client and the basic server components are 
tested and usable. ddns-clientd, ddnsd, ddns-cleand, filedns
and ddns-ipfw0 should be usable without significant Problems.

SETTING UP A CLIENT

Go to the ddns directory and type
$ make client
$ sudo make setup-client

The buildprocess will fetch files from the internet using wget.
If you don't have wget installed you have to edit the Makefile
to use another tool for fetching files via http.

You have to know your DDNS-UID (100 in this example) and your shared
secret ('superNikNik' in this example).  After you fired up your
internet connection try someting like

$ DDNS_SERVER_ADDR=c0re.rc23.cx DDNS_SERVER_PORT=3456 \
  DDNS_UID=100 KEY=superNikNik \ 
  /usr/local/bin/ddns-clientd 0.0.0.1 0 50 57 9.7 N 6 54 08.3 E 5700 5000 1500 5000

This assumes you have no IPv6 Address, which means 0.  Your Location
is Vogelsangerstr. 286 in Cologne at 57m altitude and your facility is
50m in diameter. The Number is acurate to 15m in horizontal and 50m in
vertical direction.  The last three numbers can be left out. I assume
you use a ddns Server running at c0re.rc23.cx:3456. 0.0.0.1 will be 
changed by ddns-clientd to your actual IP address.

ddns-clientd will now connect to the server and register there. It
will sleep a server specified amount of time (at the moment 90s) and
renew its registration. If it recives SIGTERM it will deregister and
exit.

now try:

$ nslookup myname.dyn.rc23.cx
Server:  localhost
Address:  127.0.0.1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    myname.dyn.rc23.cx
Address:  1.2.3.4

Welcome to the exciting world of dynamic dns!

You can insert ddns-clientd in the script you use for fireing up
your internet connection and put a "killall ddns-clientd; sleep 2" 
in your internet down script yust before you shutdown the connection.


SETTING UP A SERVER

ddnsd can be used to flexibly build a lot of different dynamic dns system.
See OVERVIEW for an introducion of what talks to whom. Have a look into
examples there is a script which will set up a dasic server suite for you.
