.SH NAME
ddns-cleand \- cleans old entrys from ddnsd/filedns directorytree
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ddns-cleand /d
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ddns-cleand runns on a ddnsd server and handles the removal of
expired entrys from the directory hierachy representing dns entrys.
.P
.B Upon startup 
.B ddns-cleand
will 
.IR chroot (3)
to the directory given by the enviroment variable
.IR $ROOT .
It then drops privileges to the user and group set by
.I $UID
and
.IR $GID .
.P
.B ddns-cleand 
will then remove entrys older then
1.5 days from the directory 
.I /tmp
to get rid of files lost by
.IR ddnsd (8)

After that traverses the directory tree given by parameter
.B /d
reading all files in there. Files with the sticky bit set will be
ignored. The files are expected to conform to
the specification of
.IR ddns-file (5).
It will parse the files and for any entrys found in 
there it looks up the uid in data.cdb.
.I data.cdb
should be created with 
.IR ddnsd-data (8)
.P
If the file's mtime is less then the actual time minus the ttl
for an entry the file is removed and a expiery message is
delivered to all fifos in
.IR /tracedir .
For further explanation of this message mechanism consult
.BR ddns-pipe (5).
.P
.B ddns-cleand
logs to stderr. 
.BR multilog (8)
is well suited for handling this.
.P
.B ddnsd 
doesn't allow to register the same uid twice but it allows to
renew or kill an entry even if it is older than it's leasetime.
